# Introduction

MMG Add-on for Blender is a set of 2 Plugins for the Blender 3D Modeling software interfacing the MMG Project and Medit Software with Blender Weight Paint Mode.

Two plugins are available on this repository:

* The first one is an import / export routine for triangulated meshes, interfacing .mesh and .sol file formats with Blender. 
Currently, only basics mesh parameters are taken into account (vertices and triangles), and only the export of .sol file is available (the import should be fixed soon).

* The second Plugin is a graphical interface for MMG, and allows the user to paint on the 3D Model with Blender tools, define the main execution parameters for MM routines, and compute a remeshed model according to those settings. A vizualization with medit is possible before re-importing the new model in Blender for further work.
